There are two files in this respository.
The first one is mandelbrot.py. These can be ran in Spyder or another Python IDE and this file creates and plots a Mandelbrot fractal. It can be tested by calling the mandelbrot function and running through three arguments: n, N_max, threshold. This determines the size of the set, the number of iterations the set will check for, and the limits that determine whether or not a point is in the Mandelbrot fractal.

The second file contains the markov_chain function. This can also be ran in a Python IDE such as Spyder and is a mathematical representation of a Markov chain that also plots out its probability distribution against the amount of iterations the function runs through. It can be tested by calling the markov_chain function and running through two arguments: n and N. This determines the size of the chain and also the number of iterations the code will run through when determining the probability distribution.
